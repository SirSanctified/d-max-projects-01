# DMAXPROJECTS

This is a practice django  based website for a renovations company.
The main purpose for this project was to learn more Javascript for frontend manipulation, CSS animations using the animation and transition properties as well as cementing my django knowledge.

This repo includes all of the static files from the static project deployed on dmaxprojects.netlify.app
